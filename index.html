      Sure he’s brash, sure he’s arrogant, sure he’s oozing with confidence, sure he’s raring to go ….. Well then, don’t we
      all want some of that? Isn’t the new brand of India all about that? Has anyone lately heard anyone, foreign or domestic,
      diplomat or business man, celebrity or common man, say anything different about India today? (Full Coverage| Points

      Back in ‘91 when our economy opened up, we had to fold our hands before foreign institutions and countries and beg them
      to invest in our country. We were polite and watchful, appealing to the world to consider us as a destination of
      prospects. Not because that was our culture but because we ourselves were unsure of how things would pan out for this
      enormous nation.
      
      We were cautious, afraid to commit, averse to take risks and played watchfully. That was the mind-set of India at that
      time. Times have changed, India has changed.

      We no longer beg, we beg to differ. We don’t wait for opportunities, we create them. We don’t just rise to applaud, we
      rise to accept the applause. Our industry is confident, our youth ambitious, our poor hopeful, and our government
      responsible.
      
      Hmm, who is Virat then? Does he not represents the new India? Confident to take on the world, ambitious to be the best
      in the world, carries hopes of millions of Indian fans, and is responsible and yes, accountable to the countless
      expectations.
      
      He wears his attitude on his sleeve, and his heart on his lips. He’s got the swagger to intimidate the enemy, panache to
      make the girls go crazy, and an innocent smile to still be his mamma’s boy. Love him or hate him, you’ve got to admire
      him.

      ‘You give me crap, I’ll give it back with interest; you disrespect me, I’ll not just earn it, I’ll demand it; you sledge
      me, you wish you never had because you’re in for more than a mouthful; you ignore me, well then too bad because I’m the
      star the world is looking at!!’
      
      Is it Virat who I am talking about or is it the New India which we all want to believe in and be living in?
      
      This is not a mere reflection of his 100 against Pakistan in ‘yet another’ world cup victory, but the reflection of a
      boy whom a former Delhi bred first class cricketer (yours truly) has closely seen, followed and revered.
      
      Played against him on 4 occasions, first time, seen him as a 14-year-old kid take his club side to victory and last
      time, a 20-year-old Indian prodigy who made mincemeat of a star studded Haryana attack and took Delhi to a comfortable
      victory in Dharmashala in a Ranji Trophy tie.
