      Sure he’s brash, sure he’s arrogant, sure he’s oozing with confidence, sure he’s raring to go ….. Well then, don’t we
      all want some of that? Isn’t the new brand of India all about that? Has anyone lately heard anyone, foreign or domestic,
      diplomat or business man, celebrity or common man, say anything different about India today? (Full Coverage| Points

      Back in ‘91 when our economy opened up, we had to fold our hands before foreign institutions and countries and beg them
      to invest in our country. We were polite and watchful, appealing to the world to consider us as a destination of
      prospects. Not because that was our culture but because we ourselves were unsure of how things would pan out for this
      enormous nation.
      
      We were cautious, afraid to commit, averse to take risks and played watchfully. That was the mind-set of India at that
      time. Times have changed, India has changed.

      We no longer beg, we beg to differ. We don’t wait for opportunities, we create them. We don’t just rise to applaud, we
      rise to accept the applause. Our industry is confident, our youth ambitious, our poor hopeful, and our government
      responsible.
      
      Hmm, who is Virat then? Does he not represents the new India? Confident to take on the world, ambitious to be the best
      in the world, carries hopes of millions of Indian fans, and is responsible and yes, accountable to the countless
      expectations.
      
      He wears his attitude on his sleeve, and his heart on his lips. He’s got the swagger to intimidate the enemy, panache to
      make the girls go crazy, and an innocent smile to still be his mamma’s boy. Love him or hate him, you’ve got to admire
      him.

      ‘You give me crap, I’ll give it back with interest; you disrespect me, I’ll not just earn it, I’ll demand it; you sledge
      me, you wish you never had because you’re in for more than a mouthful; you ignore me, well then too bad because I’m the
      star the world is looking at!!’
      
      Is it Virat who I am talking about or is it the New India which we all want to believe in and be living in?
      
      This is not a mere reflection of his 100 against Pakistan in ‘yet another’ world cup victory, but the reflection of a
      boy whom a former Delhi bred first class cricketer (yours truly) has closely seen, followed and revered.
      
      Played against him on 4 occasions, first time, seen him as a 14-year-old kid take his club side to victory and last
      time, a 20-year-old Indian prodigy who made mincemeat of a star studded Haryana attack and took Delhi to a comfortable
      victory in Dharmashala in a Ranji Trophy tie.

      Raina was named captain and Kohli vice-captain for the tri-series against Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe in Zimbabwe in May–June
      2010, as many first-choice players skipped the tour.[75] Kohli made 168 runs at an average of 42.00 including two
      fifties,[76] but India suffered three defeats in four matches and crashed out of the series. During the series, Kohli
      became the fastest Indian batsman to reach 1,000 runs in ODI cricket.[77] He made his T20I debut against Zimbabwe at
      Harare and scored an unbeaten 26.[78] Later that month, Kohli batted at 3 in an Indian team throughout the 2010 Asia Cup
      and scored a total of 67 runs at an average of 16.75.[79] His struggles with form continued in the tri-series against
      Sri Lanka and New Zealand in Sri Lanka where he averaged 15.[80]

      Despite the poor run of form, Kohli was retained in the ODI squad for a three-match series against Australia in October,
      and in the only completed match of the series at Visakhapatnam, scored his third ODI century–118 off 121 balls–which
      helped India reach the target of 290 after losing the openers early.[81][48] Winning the man of the match, he admitted
      that he was under pressure to keep his place in the team after failures in the two previous series.[82] During the home
      ODI series against New Zealand, Kohli scored a match-winning 104-ball 105, his fourth ODI hundred and second in
      succession, in the first game,[83] and followed it up with 64 and 63* in the next two matches.[48] India completed a 5–0
      whitewash of New Zealand, while Kohli's performance in the series helped him become a regular in the ODI team[84] and
      made him a strong contender for a spot in India's World Cup squad.[85] He was India's leading run-scorer in ODIs in
      2010, with 995 runs from 25 matches at an average of 47.38 including three centuries and seven fifties.[86]
      
      Kohli was India's leading run-getter in the five-match ODI series of the South African tour in January 2011, with 193
      runs at an average of 48.25 including two fifties, both in Indian defeats.[87] During the series, he jumped to number
      two spot on the ICC Rankings for Men's ODI batters,[88] and was named in India's 15-man squad for the World Cup.[89]
